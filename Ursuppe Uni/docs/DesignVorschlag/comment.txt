Accepted! You passed problemset08!

First of all you made some nice sketches and I thinkyou did not use much time for them - which is actually what we wanted and what throw-away should be.
To go on with you decision is well argumented and understandable.
BUT it's very hard to see what's going on in your "usability test" the new pictures (sketches) are much better and you can zoom in...
but I see something is going on and you made some arrows, therefore I think you solved the task (show me the papers on Friday probably?)
Your GUI looks very nice although it has some flashy updates most the time and it's pretty time consuming to actually play the game (thx for your awesome scripted test again)

Keep up your work (probably on this game ^^) 
cheers
